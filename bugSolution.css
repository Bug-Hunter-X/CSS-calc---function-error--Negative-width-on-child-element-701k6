The solution is to add a `max-width` property to the element using the `calc()` function. This prevents the calculated width from becoming negative when the parent's width is too small.  The improved code uses `max-width: calc(100% - 20px);` ensuring the width never goes below zero, and always remains within the bounds of the parent container. If the parent container width is less than 20px, the child element will simply take up the available width.
